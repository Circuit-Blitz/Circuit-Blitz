## Getting Started

To use this code, you'll need to ensure that the required libraries are installed in your Arduino environment. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the two libraries included (or directly move them if you'd prefer that):
    - `MPU6050`
    - `I2Cdev`

2. Paste them into your Arduino's libraries folder. The location of this folder depends on your operating system:
    - **Windows:** `Documents/Arduino/libraries`
    - **Mac:** `Documents/Arduino/libraries`
    - **Linux:** `~/Arduino/libraries`
